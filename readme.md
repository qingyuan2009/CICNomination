    Pre-requisitionï¼š

    Use local postgresql:
        I recommend you to install postgresql locally. Note that if you use local postgresql, you need to create 
        DB "nomination" manually and setup your postgresql user name and password properly, refer to 
        nomination.core-> resource/application.properties

    Use local docker container:
        Also you can use the local docker container to access the DB, to activate postgresql in docker:
        In mock/local, setup docker environment:
        > docker-compose up -d
    
    Click bootRun to run the application
